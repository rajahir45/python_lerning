# Define a function called analyze_numbers(numbers)

#  numbers is a list of integers   

# def analyze_numbers(numbers):
#     even_numbers = []
#     odd_numbers = []
#     even_sum = 0
#     odd_sum = 0

#     for num in numbers:
#         if num % 2 == 0:
#             even_numbers.append(num)
#             even_sum += num
#         else:
#             odd_numbers.append(num)
#             odd_sum += num

#     return {
#         "even_numbers": even_numbers,
#         "odd_numbers": odd_numbers,
#         "even_sum": even_sum,
#         "odd_sum": odd_sum
#     }


# result = analyze_numbers([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
# print(result)

# 2. QUESTION

# Inside the function:

# Use a loop to go through the list

# Use conditionals to:

# Separate even and odd numbers

# Use operators to:

# Calculate the sum of even numbers

# Calculate the sum of odd numbers

def calculate():
    
 for i in range(1,10,2):
    print(i)
if num/2 == 0:
    print("number is even")
else:
    print("number is odd")
